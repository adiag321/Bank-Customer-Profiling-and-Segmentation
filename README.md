# <align = 'center'>Bank Customer Profiling and Segmentation</p>

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this case study, I am a consultant to a bank in New York City. The bank has extensive data on their customers for the past 6 months. The marketing team at the bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.

One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.
