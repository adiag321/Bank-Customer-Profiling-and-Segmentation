# <p align = 'center'>Bank Customer Profiling and Segmentation</p>

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this case study, I am a consultant to a bank in New York City. The bank has extensive data on their customers for the past 6 months. The marketing team at the bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.

One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.

#### What we will do - 

* In this project, you have been hired as a data scientist at a bank and you have been provided with extensive data on the bank's customers for the past 6 months.
* Data includes transactions frequency, amount, tenure..etc.
* The bank marketing team would like to leverage AI/ML to `launch a targeted marketing ad campaign` that is tailored to specific group of customers.
* In order for this campaign to be successful, the bank has to `divide its customers into at least 3 distinctive groups`.
* This process is known as `marketing segmentation` and it crucial for maximizing marketing campaign conversion rate.
